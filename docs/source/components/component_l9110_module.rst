L9110 Motor Driver Module
=============================

The L9110 motor driver module is adept at driving two motors in tandem. It houses a pair of independent L9110S driver chips, 
each channel boasting a steady current output of up to 800mA.

Spanning a voltage range from 2.5V to 12V, the module comfortably pairs with both 3.3V and 5V microcontrollers.

Serving as a streamlined solution, the L9110 motor driver module facilitates motor control across a spectrum of applications. 
Thanks to its dual-channel architecture, it enables the independent orchestration of two motors—ideal for projects where dual motor 
operations are paramount.

Given its potent continuous current output, this module confidently powers motors from the petite to the moderately sized, 
paving the way for diverse robotic, automation, and motor-centric endeavors. Its expansive voltage range further injects adaptability, aligning with varied power supply setups.

Designed with user-friendliness in mind, the module offers intuitive input and output terminals, simplifying connections to microcontrollers 
or akin control devices. Plus, it doesn't skimp on safety—integrated overcurrent and overtemperature safeguards bolster the trustworthiness 
and security of motor operations.
