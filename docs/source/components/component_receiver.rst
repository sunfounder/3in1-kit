* **S**: Signal output
* **-**: GND
* **+**: power supply, 3.3v~5V

SL838 infrared-receiver is a component which receives infrared signals and can independently receive infrared rays and output signals compatible with TTL level. It is similar with a normal plastic-packaged transistor in size and is suitable for all kinds of infrared remote control and infrared transmission.

Infrared, or IR, communication is a popular, low-cost, easy-to-use wireless communication technology. Infrared light has a slightly longer wavelength than visible light, so it is imperceptible to the human eye - ideal for wireless communication. A common modulation scheme for infrared communication is 38KHz modulation.


* Can be used for remote control
* Wide operating voltage: 2.7~5V
* Internal filter for PCM frequency
* TTL and CMOS compatibility
* Strong anti-interference ability
* Compliant RoHS


**Remote Control**
