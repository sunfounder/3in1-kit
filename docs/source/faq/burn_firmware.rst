**2. Burning the firmware**

* Follow the steps below to burn the firmware if you are using **Windows**.

    #. Download firmware and burn-in tool.

        * :download:`ESP8266 Firmware <https://github.com/sunfounder/3in1-kit/raw/main/iot_project/esp8266_firmware.zip>`

    #. After unzipping, you will see 3 files.

        .. image:: img/bat_firmware.png
    
        * ``BAT_AT_V1.7.1.0_1M.bin``: The firmware to burn to the ESP8266 module.
        * ``esptool.exe``: This is a command-line utility for Windows.
        * ``install.bat``: This is the command package for Windows system, double click this file will run all the commands inside the file.

    #. Double click ``install.bat`` to start the firmware burning. If you see the following prompt, the firmware has been installed successfully.

        .. note::
            If the burn-in fails, please check the following points.

            * Reset the ESP8266 module by inserting the RST on the ESP8266 Adapter to GND and then unplugging it.
            * Check if the wiring is correct.
            * Whether the computer has recognized your board properly, and make sure the port is not occupied.
            * Reopen the install.bat file.

* To burn the firmware, follow these steps if you are using a **Mac OS** system.

    #. Use the following commands to install Esptool. Esptool is a Python-based, open-source, platform-independent utility to communicate with the ROM bootloader in Espressif chips.

        .. code-block::

            python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
            python3 -m pip install esptool

    #. If esptool is properly installed, it will output a message such as [usage: esptool] if you run ``python3 -m esptool``.

    #. Download firmware.

        * :download:`ESP8266 Firmware <https://github.com/sunfounder/3in1-kit/raw/main/iot_project/esp8266_firmware.zip>`

    #. After unzipping, you will see 3 files.

        .. image:: img/bat_firmware.png

        * ``BAT_AT_V1.7.1.0_1M.bin``: The firmware to burn to the ESP8266 module.
        * ``esptool.exe``: This is a command-line utility for Windows.
        * ``install.bat``: This is the command package for Windows system, double click this file will run all the commands inside the file.

    #. Open a terminal and use the ``cd`` command to go into the firmware folder you just downloaded, then run the following command to erase the existing firmware and re-burn the new firmware.

        .. code-block::

            python3 -m esptool --chip esp8266 --before default_reset erase_flash
            python3 -m esptool --chip esp8266 --before default_reset write_flash 0 "BAT_AT_V1.7.1.0_1M.bin"

    #. If you see the following prompt, the firmware has been installed successfully.

        .. image:: img/install_firmware_macos.png

        .. note::
            If the burn-in fails, please check the following points.

            * Reset the ESP8266 module by inserting the RST on the ESP8266 Adapter to GND and then unplugging it.
            * Check if the wiring is correct.
            * Whether the computer has recognized your board properly, and make sure the port is not occupied.
            * Reopen the install.bat file.

**3. Test**

#. On the basis of the original wiring, connect IO1 to 3V3.

    .. image:: img/connect_esp826612.png
        :width: 800

#. You will be able to see information about the ESP8266 module if you click the magnifying glass icon(Serial Monitor) in the upper right corner and set the baud rate to **115200**.

    .. note::

        * If ``ready`` doesn't appear, you can try to reset the ESP8266 module(connect RST to GND) and re-open the Serial Monitor.

#. Click on **NEWLINE DROPDOWN BOX**, select ``both NL & CR`` in the drop down option, enter ``AT``, if it returns OK, it means ESP8266 has successfully established connection with R3 board.
