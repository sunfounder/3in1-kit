3.3 Detect the Obstacle
===================================

This module is commonly installed on the car and robot to judge the
existence of the obstacles ahead. Also it is widely used in hand held
device, water faucet and so on.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

The digital pin 2 is used to read the
signal of IR Obstacle Avoidance Module. We get the VCC of IR
Sensor Module connected to 5V, GND to GND, OUT to digital pin 2.
