=====================

Please follow the steps below to complete the assembly of the car.

1. Remove the protective film on the acrylic.

2. Place the board on the table as shown in the picture, the side with the same hole as the R4 board, we call A; the back is B. This will help you avoid mistakes during assembly.

#. Turn to the B side, use **M3x30mm screws** and **M3 nuts** to attach the TT Motor. 2 details here: 1 - the output shaft is facing the bat-shaped side; 2 - the motor cable is facing the inside.

#. Mount another TT Motor, the same attention needs to be paid to the direction of the output shaft and the direction of the cable.

#. Turn to side B and attach the Line Track module with four **M3x6mm screws** and two **M3x24mm standoffs**.

    .. note::
        It's advisable to first secure the **M3x24mm standoffs** onto the Line Track module.

        One important note to keep in mind: the pins of the line sensor are slightly soft and protrude a bit towards the holes. When screwing in the **M3x24mm standoffs**, apply gentle pressure to push aside the sensor pins slightly.

#. Stick the velcro on the 9V battery and put on the battery clip. Stick the other section of the Velcro on the car to secure the battery.
