#. Turn to side B and attach the Line Track module with four **M3x6mm screws** and two **M3x24mm standoffs**.

    .. note::
        It's advisable to first secure the **M3x24mm standoffs** onto the Line Track module.

        One important note to keep in mind: the pins of the line sensor are slightly soft and protrude a bit towards the holes. When screwing in the **M3x24mm standoffs**, apply gentle pressure to push aside the sensor pins slightly.
